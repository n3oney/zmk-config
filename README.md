# zmk-config

Based on [markstos's layout](https://mark.stosberg.com/markstos-corne-3x5-1-keyboard-layout/), adapted to ZMK with a few changes:

- added bluetooth control keys in function layer
- added printscreen key
- removed 3x click mod to lock (I don't know how to implement it, if you can, please do)
